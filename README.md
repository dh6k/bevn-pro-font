## Description <a name="description"></a>

This user style applies the Google ~~Chivo~~ Be Vietnam Pro font to every page you visit. I have made some changes in it so websites don't break. This will not change the following:

- Monospace font
- Icons - this theme is set up to ignore icons and doesn't mess up icons on most websites (There were issues on some websites).



## Known Issues <a name="known-issues"></a>

- Text duplication on some websites when you highlight the text. Known websites where this issue occurs include:
  - GitHub
  - Google Collab
